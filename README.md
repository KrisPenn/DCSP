# DCSP
Character Sheet Project for DCSP

DATABASE SETUP:

Local:

  Use xampp to go to "localhost/phpmyadmin".
  From this page, go to the databases tab and create a new database named
  "dcsp_Project".

  After the database has been created in phpmyadmin, then use xampp to navigate
  to setup.php within the project files and run it.  This will create a users
  table with an users admin and BasicUser.  Their passwords can be found within
  the setup.php file.

  Be sure not to change the setup.php file before running or the creation of the
  database will messup.
